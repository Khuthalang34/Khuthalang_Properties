---------------- instructions To Run The System: -----------------

*************************************************************************************


Please note that inorder to get your Xamp or Wamp started, please do the following:

--xamp --

1. Open xamp folder from your Local C drive. Inside Xamp folder look for xampp-control.exe and open the application. A control panel will be open and click start on Apache and MySQL.

-- wamp --

1.Open wamp folder from your Local C drive. Inside wamp folder look for wampmanager.exe and wait for a green wamp icon to display on your notification bar on the bottom right corner of your screen and you are all set.




*************************************************************************************


1. Download Xamp (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or wamp server (https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/)
2. Install either Wamp or Xamp
3. Open Local C Drive:
4. If you installed:

---Wamp, look for the folder called wamp and navigation to wamp64(for 64Bits) or wamp (for 32Bit) > and paste it in folder called 'www'
---xamp look for the folder called xamp and navigate to xamp and paste it in folder called htdocs

5. To Run the system open your browser preferably Google Chrome. Internet Explora might not work to perfection but I recomend Google Chrome. When you open your browser, type localhost/name_of_the_folder (e.g localhost/k3) or you can type 127.0.0.1/name_of_the_folder (e.g 127.0.0.1/k3)
